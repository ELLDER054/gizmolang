      <h2>Variables</h2>
      <br/>
      Gizmo has 5 data types: int, string, bool, real, and char.
      To declare a variable, put code in this format:
      &lt;type&rt; &lt;name&rt; = &lt;value&rt;;
      Be sure to include the semi-colon at the end.
      You cannot redeclare variables and the type you assign your variable cannot be changed.
      You also can't say a variable one type, then make it's value another type.
      Here is an example.
      </br><br/>
      <code>int a = "abc";</code>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      The folling error would be the result.
      <br/><br/>
      <code>On line 1<br/>
      Value of variable `a`(string) must match the given type(int)<br/>
      int a = "abc";<br/>
      <pre>        ^</pre></code>
