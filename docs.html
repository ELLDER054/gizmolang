      <h2>Variables</h2>
      <br/>
      <pre>
      Gizmo has 5 data types: int, string, bool, real, and char.
      To declare a variable, put code in this format:
      &lt;type&gt; &lt;name&gt; = &lt;value&gt;;
      Be sure to include the semi-colon at the end.
      You cannot redeclare variables and the type you assign your variable cannot be changed.
      You also can't say a variable one type, then make it's value another type.
      Here is an example.
      </pre>
      <pre class="code">
      int a = "abc";
      </pre>
      <pre>
      The folling error would be the result.</pre>
      <pre class="code">
      On line 1
      Value of variable `a`(string) must match the given type(int)
      int a = "abc";<br/>
              ^</pre>
