<h2>A Nice Language To Use</h2>
Friendly errors and no chance of all the complicated and hard to fix errors makes Gizmo an
extremely nice language to use. No need to keep track of memory or
care about lifetimes anymore. Gizmo does a lot of the
hard work for you, letting you work efficiently and
quickly.

<h2>Familiar Syntax, Modern Constructs</h2>
Gizmo aims to keep a familiar C-like syntax while
allowing the user to use more modern programming
constructs like the ones you would find in JavaScript.

<h2>Features of The Compiler</h2>
The Gizmo compiler has many features. Including 

1. A C front-end
2. An LLVM back-end
3. A smart parser, which combines both phases 2 and 3
4. A small and simple scanner/lexer

<h2>Guide To Looking At The Source Code</h2>
All code will be found in the "src" folder in the main repository.
The c front-end code is in the "front-end" folder.
The llvm back-end code is in the "back-end" folder.
The "compiler.c" file is the brain of the whole compiler. It calls all the phases and opens the files needed.
The "main.sh" file is the file actually called by the user.
All the other folders are either READMEs or git reminders.
